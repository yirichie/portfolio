<blockquote>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"</blockquote>

I hear this quote thrown around quite often and it's commonly credited to Einstein. Whether he actually said it or not, I think it does apply to most things.

JavaScript is always changing (especially with ECMAScript) and it's probably impossible to know everything there is to know about the language unless you're someone like Kyle Simpson.
There's always going to be a new framework to learn, a new library to try out, or some JavaScript quirk you've never noticed.

For these reasons, I thought this blog would be a great way to pass on the knowledge that I've learned and to also challenge myself to learn new things that I can explain simply through a blog post.

Thanks for joining me on this journey!
